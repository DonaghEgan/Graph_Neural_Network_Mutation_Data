# Summary of Changes Made to main.py

## Key Improvements Implemented:

### 1. **Enhanced Model Initialization**
- Added `dropout=0.3` parameter to the model for regularization
- Model now uses the improved architecture from model.py

### 2. **Better Optimizer**
- **Before**: `torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=1e-2)`
- **After**: `torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=1e-3, weight_decay=1e-4, betas=(0.9, 0.999))`
- AdamW is generally superior to SGD for deep learning
- Added weight decay for L2 regularization

### 3. **Learning Rate Scheduling**
- Added `CosineAnnealingLR` scheduler
- Learning rate will decrease from 1e-3 to 1e-6 over 50 epochs
- Helps with convergence and prevents overshooting minima

### 4. **Improved Training Function**
- **L2 Regularization**: Added explicit L2 penalty to loss function
- **Gradient Clipping**: Added `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)`
- **Better Loss Tracking**: Separates Cox loss from total loss for monitoring

### 5. **Early Stopping**
- Implemented `EarlyStopping` class with patience=25
- Automatically saves best model when validation loss improves
- Stops training if no improvement for 25 epochs
- Prevents overfitting and saves computation time

### 6. **Enhanced Training Loop**
- **Learning Rate Monitoring**: Shows current learning rate each epoch
- **Dual Model Saving**: Saves both best loss model and best C-index model
- **Better Logging**: More informative epoch output

### 7. **Test Set Evaluation**
- Added comprehensive test set evaluation at the end
- Tests both the early stopping model and best C-index model
- Provides final performance metrics

## Expected Benefits:

1. **Better Convergence**: AdamW + scheduling should converge faster and more stably
2. **Reduced Overfitting**: Dropout, L2 regularization, and early stopping
3. **Training Stability**: Gradient clipping prevents gradient explosion
4. **Automatic Stopping**: No need to manually stop training
5. **Better Final Model**: Automatically saves and loads best performing model

## Running the Improved Model:

Your existing command should work exactly the same:
```bash
python main.py
```

The model will now:
- Train more efficiently with better optimization
- Automatically stop when it starts overfitting
- Save the best models automatically
- Provide comprehensive final evaluation

## Key Changes Summary:
- ✅ **AdamW Optimizer** instead of SGD
- ✅ **Learning Rate Scheduling** with cosine annealing
- ✅ **L2 Regularization** added to loss
- ✅ **Gradient Clipping** for stability
- ✅ **Early Stopping** to prevent overfitting
- ✅ **Enhanced Logging** with learning rate tracking
- ✅ **Automatic Model Saving** for best models
- ✅ **Test Set Evaluation** at completion

The model should now train more robustly and achieve better performance!
